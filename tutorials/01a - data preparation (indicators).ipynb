    "Prepared by Omar A. Guerrero (oguerrero@turing.ac.uk, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guerrero_oa\">@guerrero_oa</a>)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first tutorial of PPI, and its purpose is to demonstrate how you can prepare a dataset of indicators to be in the best shape for its use with the model. I will pre-process a raw dataset coming from the Sustainable Development Report 2022. However, these data do not represent any particular country as I have chosen a sample of indicators randomly (across countries). The objective of the tutorial is to show you how to normalise and extract the relevant features from these data to calibrate the model of PPI."

    "The <strong>bestBound</strong> and <strong>worstBound</strong> are the so-called technical or theoretical limits of an indicator. The former determines the highest possible value and the latter the lowest. In this tutorial, they will help me to normalise each indicator between 0 and 1. Sometimes, technical bounds are provided by the data; others, you need to determine them according to prior knowledge or expert advice. In this example, I have taken values from the Sustainable Development Report that are declared as the optimum and the possible worst. Therefore, strictly speaking they are not technical bounds. I will also normalise the technical bounds (turning them into 1s and 0s) to use them in PPI.\n",

Collateral indicators, on the other hand, are those for which there are no expenditure programmes, either because they simply do not exist, or because the indicator is too aggregate for any government to claim that they have a reliable impact through their programmes."

    "## Building new variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I will build a couple of additional variables that are necessary to calibrate and run PPI:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <strong>I0</strong>: The initial values of the indicators in the sample period.\n",
    "* <strong>IF</strong>: The final values of the indicators in the sample period.\n",
    "* <strong>successRates</strong>: The number of times that an indicator improved as a fraction of the number of times it changed in the sample period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter <strong>I0</strong> provides the initial condition of each indicator when running retrospective simulations. This means that <strong>I0</strong> is necessary for calibration. However, once calibrated, <strong>I0</strong> can be changed to perform prospective simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The levels in <strong>IF</strong> correspond to the last value that each indicator achieved in the sample period. Together with <strong>I0</strong>, these vectors help building the trend feature that PPI will attempt to calibrate. Nevertheless, it is recommended to manually check <strong>IF</strong>, as it could be the case that the last value in the time series was the result of an exogenous shock or idiosyncratic factors (it would exhibit a behaviour that is not consistent with the indicator's historical pattern). If that was the case, it is advised to adjust the last value of the time series in an attempt to better represent the trend component of the indicator, for example, one could fit a regression model or a Gaussian process and correct the last observation using the predicted value. In these tutorials, I will not make such verification, and directly use the final values reported in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The column <strong>successRates</strong> is used to calibrate PPI by minimising a second type of error that relates to a different feature of the data. The idea is that the model endogenously produces a success rate that, on average, matches the empirical one. This means that one needs to compute, from the data, how often each indicator improves, in relation to the number of attempts to improve. For this dataset, in which I have more than 20 observation per time series, I can simply count how many times an indicator improved from one period to another, and divide that amount by the number times that the indicator changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success rates for short time series\n",
    "\n",
    "If a time series is too short, the above calculation may be problematic as it would not be representative of the average success rate. In that case, one could deploy non-linear data imputation methods such as Gaussian processes to augment the series. Alternatively, if there are multiple indicators that belong to the same policy dimension, a reasonable strategy could be to group them and consider that they are realisations of very similar policies. Thus, the sample success rate could be calculated by pulling the changes of all these indicators. In this strategy, the success rate would be the same for the indicators belonging to the same group, but each indicator would still preserve its own trend feature. The same grouping strategy could apply if it is reasonable to assume that multiple geographical units (e.g., countries, regions, states, etc.) have similar policies on the same policy dimension. Finally, all these straegies could be combined together, as I have done in https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-022-01095-1 using a multi-output Gaussian process approach called `mogptk` (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2020.09.085).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not think that the assumptions behind the aforementioned techniques are reasonable, then the best choice is always to remove these indicators from your dataset, and explude them from your study."

That is, the difference between the final and initial values. It is important to make sure that these two values are different from each other, i.e. that the development gap is non-zero, otherwise the calibration method will not be able to define the gap error (and will throw and exception). Thus, here I will introduce a slight modification to the final values to assure that I get non-zero gaps."

    "PPI takes into account the role of public governance. First, it considers the quality of the monitoring mechanisms of the central authority to spot inefficiencies. Second, it accounts for the quality of the rule of law to exercise corrective measures when an inefficiency is discovered. In PPI's empirical applications, these parameters come from public indicators from the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (https://doi.org/10.1017/S1876404511200046). Their values need to be between 0 and 1, and they can be specific to each indicator if the user has information about how heterogeneous is public governance across different policy issues.\n",

    "For the hypothetical country in these tutorials, I assume that both parameters are homogeneous across indicators, and that both have a value of 0.5.
